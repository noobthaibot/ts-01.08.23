VueJS Assessment Task 

Create a new VueJS v3 project
Install the Vuetify3 library
Install the Vuelidate library
Install the VueRouter library

Use Composition API only (setup function)

Feel free to design the app as you like, we appreciate aesthetically pleasing designs. Please utilize the Vuetify library to create widgets, forms, cards, etc.

Create a form in the center of the screen inside the <v-card> with input fields for email, password, and a login button. Upon clicking the login button, use the vuelidate library to validate the input fields. Ensure that the email input field contains a valid email address and the password field contains at least 6 characters. If an error occurs, display it below the corresponding input field. Otherwise, redirect the user to the /game page.

Create two input fields labeled 'Size X' and 'Size Y'. Users can input two values, for example 'Size X = 64' and 'Size Y = 64'. The app should then draw 64 small squares horizontally and 64 squares vertically. The size of each square should be 36x36 pixels, colored white, on the dark background.

When the user hovers his mouse over a square, it should change color to blue if it was originally white, or to white if it was originally blue. If the user changes the values of 'Size X' or 'Size Y', the squares should be redrawn accordingly.



Upload the project to your Github and provide a link. 
Time to complete the task is 2 hours.
